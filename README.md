# Group Project 1: Marvel Mystery Matcher

## Project Description

This group project was executed by Appoline, Charles, Rosa and Sam.
The project uses everything learned over the past six modules to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. This project was also the opportunity to learn about agile development methodologies to help us work collaboratively as a group, to implement features and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Project requirements

The main acceptance criteria for this project were as follow:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages
- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input)
- Use at least two server-side APIs (Links to an external site.)
- Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data
- Be responsive
- Have a polished UI
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on)
- Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

The project was presented by the group members and addressed the following:

- Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of the application
- Concept: What is our user story? What was our motivation for development?
- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did we encounter? What were our successes?
- Demo of the application
- Directions for future development

## What we learned

This project was the opportunity to lean a lot about colloboration and how to use github as a group. We had been fetching the weather API for our previous challenge but this project deepened our understanding and practise of fetching API data with the 2 APIs we chose and had never used before.
We used Bulma for the styling of of project and learning to use a new CSS framework was a great experience and this will definitely help when we have to implement a new one for future projects.

## Challenges

Up until now we had only been using github individually so using it as a group was a challenge initially. We had some issues with branches and merging them. After 2 weeks using it we have learned a lot and feel comfortable using it collaboratively.
Using the API was also tricky and we encountered some roadblocks during the project. We had to find a new API as one of them was not working as we initially hoped.
